# Microsoft Teams Tab Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you set up and test the Corvus ADX application as a Microsoft Teams tab locally.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Microsoft Teams (desktop or web)
- Access to a Microsoft Teams organization where you can sideload apps

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
# The app now runs on HTTPS (required for Teams)
npm run dev
```
The server will start at `https://localhost:3000`

### 2. Generate Teams App Package
```bash
# Creates a .zip file ready for Teams sideloading
npm run teams:package
```
This creates `teams-package/corvus-adx-teams-app.zip`

### 3. Sideload in Microsoft Teams
1. Open Microsoft Teams (desktop or web)
2. Go to **Apps** ‚Üí **Manage your apps**
3. Click **"Upload an app"** ‚Üí **"Upload a custom app"**
4. Select the generated `corvus-adx-teams-app.zip` file
5. Click **"Add"** to install the app

## Features

### Teams Integration
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS Development Server** - Required for Teams apps
- ‚úÖ **Teams Context Detection** - Detects when running in Teams vs browser
- ‚úÖ **Theme Support** - Automatically adapts to Teams light, dark, and high-contrast themes
- ‚úÖ **User Context** - Displays logged-in Teams user information
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design** - Optimized for Teams tab containers

### Visual Indicators
- **üéØ Teams Tab** - Shows when running in Teams with user name
- **üåê Browser Mode** - Shows when running in regular browser
- **Theme Adaptation** - Seamlessly switches between Teams themes

### Teams Themes Supported
- **Default/Light Theme** - Standard Teams appearance
- **Dark Theme** - Dark mode with adjusted colors
- **High Contrast** - Accessibility-focused high contrast mode

## Development Workflow

### Build and Package for Teams
```bash
# Build production version and create Teams package
npm run teams:build
```

### Local Testing
1. **Browser Testing**: Visit `https://localhost:3000` directly
2. **Teams Testing**: Use sideloaded app in Teams

### SSL Certificate
The app automatically generates SSL certificates using `mkcert` for HTTPS support. You may need to:
1. Accept the browser security warning for localhost
2. Or install the certificate in your system keychain for seamless operation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Certificate Warnings
**Problem**: Browser shows SSL certificate warnings
**Solution**: 
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost" in your browser
- Or run `mkcert -install` to trust the local CA

#### 2. Teams App Won't Load
**Problem**: Blank screen or loading issues in Teams
**Solution**:
- Ensure development server is running on `https://localhost:3000`
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Teams has network access to localhost

#### 3. App Package Upload Fails
**Problem**: Teams rejects the app package
**Solution**:
- Ensure all required files are in the package (manifest.json, color.png, outline.png)
- Check manifest.json for syntax errors
- Verify icons are correct dimensions (96x96 for color, 32x32 for outline)

### Development Tips

#### Testing Both Modes
- **Teams Mode**: Install app in Teams to test full integration
- **Browser Mode**: Access `https://localhost:3000` to test without Teams context

#### Theme Testing
Switch Teams themes to test visual adaptation:
- Teams Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Theme

#### User Context Testing
The app displays different information based on Teams user context:
- In Teams: Shows user name and Teams-specific UI
- In Browser: Shows browser mode indicator

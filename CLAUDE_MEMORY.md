# 🧠 Claude Memory: Corvus ADX Teams Application Enhancement

## 📋 Project Overview
**Application**: Microsoft Teams app for querying Azure Data Explorer (ADX) databases with natural language  
**Technology Stack**: React TypeScript, Vite, Chart.js, OpenAI API, Microsoft Teams SDK  
**Repository**: https://github.com/TorgeirI/corvus-data-client.git  
**Current Status**: Enhanced Mock ADX Database Complete (Step 1 of 4)

## 🎯 Enhancement Plan (4-Step Implementation)

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Step 1 - Enhanced Mock ADX Database Emulation**
**Goal**: Make the mock data service behave more like a real ADX database

**Achievements**:
- Enhanced KQL query parser with support for join, union, extend, distinct operators
- Implemented proper datetime filtering with KQL syntax (ago, between, startofday, endofday, startofweek)
- Added comprehensive aggregation functions (summarize, bin, percentile, dcount, avg, sum, min, max, stdev, make_list, make_set)
- Created 4 new database tables: VesselMaintenance, WeatherData, NavigationData, AlertsAndEvents
- Implemented multi-table JOIN operations (inner, left, right, full outer) with complex WHERE clauses
- Added support for time-based aggregations (hourly, daily, weekly bins)
- Expanded database schema from 2 to 6 tables with proper relationships
- Fixed natural language to KQL conversion with intelligent fallback system

### 🚧 **PENDING: Step 2 - Improved KQL Query Generation**
**Goal**: Generate more sophisticated KQL queries from natural language

**Planned Tasks**:
- Enhanced NL to KQL conversion with vessel-specific context and domain knowledge
- Smart query builder component with visual interface
- Query templates for common maritime monitoring scenarios
- Query autocomplete and syntax highlighting
- Enhanced AI prompt engineering with maritime domain expertise

### 🚧 **PENDING: Step 3 - Advanced Interactive Chart Features**
**Goal**: Create more sophisticated and interactive data visualizations

**Planned Tasks**:
- New chart types: scatter plots, heatmaps, gauge charts, multi-axis charts
- Enhanced chart interactivity: drill-down functionality, real-time updates, annotations
- Multi-chart dashboards with customizable layouts
- Advanced export options: PNG, SVG, PDF reports, scheduled generation

### 🚧 **PENDING: Step 4 - Integration and Testing**
**Goal**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly

**Planned Tasks**:
- Update Query Interface to support new features
- Comprehensive test scenarios for enhanced functionality
- Updated error handling for new query types and visualizations
- Performance optimization for complex queries and large datasets

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Enhanced Mock ADX)

### **6 Comprehensive Tables**:
1. **BatteryReadings** (13 columns) - Time series battery sensor data
2. **VesselInfo** (6 columns) - Vessel fleet information and specifications
3. **VesselMaintenance** (14 columns) - Maintenance schedules, costs, technician assignments
4. **WeatherData** (12 columns) - Maritime weather conditions across regions
5. **NavigationData** (14 columns) - Vessel positioning, routes, fuel consumption
6. **AlertsAndEvents** (13 columns) - System alerts, warnings, operational events

### **Realistic Data Generation**:
- **13 vessels** with different types: cargo, tanker, passenger, fishing, research
- **Time series patterns**: Operational cycles, seasonal variations, realistic fault scenarios
- **Geographic coverage**: North Sea, Baltic Sea, Norwegian Sea, Atlantic regions
- **Maintenance workflows**: Work orders, technician assignments, cost tracking
- **Alert systems**: Severity levels, acknowledgment workflows, resolution tracking

## 🔧 Enhanced KQL Parser Capabilities

### **Supported KQL Operations**:
```kql
-- Complex filtering with time functions
BatteryReadings 
| where timestamp >= ago(24h) and batteryHealth < 85
| summarize avg(voltage), max(temperature) by vesselType, bin(timestamp, 1h)

-- Multi-table joins
BatteryReadings 
| join VesselMaintenance on vesselId 
| where maintenanceType == "emergency" and batteryHealth < 80

-- Advanced aggregations with statistical functions
AlertsAndEvents 
| where severity in ("high", "critical") and not resolved
| summarize dcount(vesselId), percentile(timestamp, 95), make_list(eventType) by severity

-- Complex WHERE clauses with AND/OR logic
WeatherData
| where (windSpeed > 25 or waveHeight > 3) and timestamp >= startofday(ago(1d))
| project timestamp, windSpeed, waveHeight, seaState
```

### **Advanced Features**:
- **JOIN Operations**: Inner, left, right, full outer joins across all tables
- **Time Functions**: ago(), between(), startofday(), endofday(), startofweek(), bin()
- **Aggregations**: avg(), sum(), count(), min(), max(), dcount(), percentile(), stdev()
- **Complex WHERE**: AND/OR logic, parentheses, NOT, IN, contains, startswith, endswith
- **String Functions**: contains, startswith, endswith for text pattern matching
- **NULL Handling**: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL conditions

## 🧠 Natural Language Processing

### **Intelligent Fallback System**:
When OpenAI API key is not configured, the system uses pattern-based KQL generation:

**Supported Query Patterns**:
- Time ranges: "last 24 hours", "yesterday", "last week", "today"
- Vessel filtering: "vessel Atlantic", "cargo vessels"
- Battery conditions: "low battery health", "battery health below 80"
- Temperature: "high temperature", "cold conditions"
- Maintenance: "pending maintenance", "critical maintenance", "emergency repairs"
- Weather: "stormy conditions", "rough weather"
- Alerts: "unresolved alerts", "critical alerts", "high priority events"

**Example Conversions**:
```
Input: "Show battery data from the last 24 hours"
Output: BatteryReadings | where timestamp >= ago(24h) | top 100 by timestamp desc

Input: "Which vessels have low battery health?"
Output: BatteryReadings | where batteryHealth < 85 | top 100 by timestamp desc

Input: "What maintenance is pending?"
Output: VesselMaintenance | where status == "pending" | top 100 by scheduledDate desc
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### **Browser Console Testing**:
```javascript
// Test direct KQL execution

// Test natural language conversion
await nlToKqlService.convertToKQL("Show battery data from last 24 hours")

// Test complex JOIN query
await mockDataService.executeKQLQuery("BatteryReadings | join VesselMaintenance on vesselId | where batteryHealth < 85")
```

### **Sample Natural Language Queries**:
- "Show battery data from the last 24 hours"
